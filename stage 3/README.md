<h1>Stage 3/8: Make your choice</h1>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>If there is only one word, the game becomes dull. You already know the word, and there&rsquo;s no challenge. In this stage, let&apos;s make the game more difficult by choosing a word from the special list with a variety of options. This way, our game gains in replayability.</p>
<h5>Objectives</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create the following list of words:&nbsp;python,&nbsp;java,&nbsp;swift,&nbsp;javascript;</li>
    <li>Program the game to choose a word from the list at random (you can use the&nbsp;random&nbsp;library for that). You can enter more words, but let&apos;s stick to these four for now.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (&gt;&nbsp;) represents the user input. Note that it&apos;s not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>:&nbsp;<em>computer chooses python from the list.</em></p>
<pre>H A N G M A N
Guess the word: &gt; python
You survived!</pre>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>computer chooses something other than python from the list.</em></p>
<pre>H A N G M A N
Guess the word: &gt; python
You lost!</pre>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>computer randomly chooses something other than swift from the list.</em></p>
<pre>H A N G M A N
Guess the word: &gt; swift
You lost!</pre>
