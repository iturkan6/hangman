<h1>Stage 4/8: Help is on the way</h1>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>The game is now more difficult to beat; your chances of guessing the word depend on the list size. If there are four words in the list, you have a 25% chance. Let&apos;s show a little mercy and add hints for our players.</p>
<h5>Objectives</h5>
<ul>
    <li>As in the previous stage, use the following word list:&nbsp;python,&nbsp;java,&nbsp;swift,&nbsp;javascript;</li>
    <li>Once the computer has chosen a word from the list, show its first three letters. Replace the hidden letters with hyphens (-).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (&gt;&nbsp;) represents the user input. Note that it&apos;s not part of the input.</p>
